    <p>The counter() function returns a “counter” object. This object has two methods: count() returns the next integer, and reset() resets the internal state. The first thing to understand is that the two methods share access to the private variable n. The sec  ond thing to understand is that each invocation of counter() creates a new scope—independent of the scopes used by previous invocations—and a new private variable within that scope. So if you call counter() twice, you get two counter objects with      different private variables. Calling count() or reset() on one counter object has no effect on the other.</p>
        <script>
            function counter() {
         let n = 0;
         return {
         count: function() { return n++; },
         reset: function() { n = 0; }
         };
        }
        let c = counter(), d = counter(); // Create two counters
        c.count() // => 0
        d.count() // => 0: they count independently
        c.reset(); // reset() and count() methods share state
        c.count() // => 0: because we reset c
        d.count() // => 1: d was not reset
