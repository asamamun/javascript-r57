        Arrow functions do not have their own this context. Instead, they inherit the this value from the enclosing
        scope at the time the function is defined. This behavior makes arrow functions particularly useful in scenarios
        where you want to maintain the lexical scope of this.
    </p>
    <script>
        const arrowFunction = () => {
            console.log(this.name);
        };

        const obj = {
            name: "Object",
            method: arrowFunction
        };

        obj.method(); // Output: undefined (or whatever 'this' is outside)

        const otherObj = {
            name: "Other Object"
        };

        arrowFunction.call(otherObj); // Output: undefined (or whatever 'this' is outside)
