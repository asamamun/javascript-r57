        Write a program which will test user email address. When the script 10
executes, a prompt asks user to enter email address. If the script logic finds ‘@ ‘and
‘.’ symbols in email address that is entered then the output will be “ Email Address is
correct” otherwise “ Email Address is Wrong”.
    </p>
    <script>
        let em = prompt("enter email address");//abc@gmaicom
        let at = em.indexOf("@");
        let dot = em.indexOf(".");
        //console.log(at + dot)
if(at != -1 && dot != -1){
    console.log("Email Address is correct")
}
else{
    console.log("Email Address is Wrong")
}
    </script>
