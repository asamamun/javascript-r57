    <h1>JavaScript types can be divided into two categories: primitive types and object types.</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>primitive types: JavaScript's primitive types include numbers, strings of text (known as strings), and
            Boolean truth values (known as booleans).The special JavaScript values null and undefined are primitive
            values.
        </li>
        <li>
            Any JavaScript value that is not a number, a string, a boolean, a symbol, null, or undefined is an object. An object (that is, a member of the type object) is a collection of properties where each property has a name and a value. <br>
            The language also defines a special kind of object, known as an array, that represents an ordered collection of numbered values. The JavaScript language includes special syntax for working with arrays, and arrays have some special behavior that distinguishes them from ordinary objects. <br>
            A Set object represents a set of values. <br> 
            A Map object represents a mapping from keys to values. <br>
        </li>
    </ul>
